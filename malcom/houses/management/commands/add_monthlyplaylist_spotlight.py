        Add a performer's most popular song as a spotlight entry to a monthly playlist.

        The command finds the performer's most popular song (by youtube_view_count)
        that is not yet in any monthly playlist, and adds it to the specified playlist
        with is_spotlight=True.

        Requirements:
        - Performer must have at least one performance scheduled in the target playlist month
        - Performer cannot already have a song in the target playlist

        Songs are filtered by:
        - Must have YouTube view count data
        - Duration must be <= MAX_SONG_SELECTION_DURATION_MINUTES (default: 10 minutes)
        - Must not already be in any playlist

        IMPORTANT: Spotlight entries do NOT affect the performer's playlist_weight.
        This ensures that manual spotlight additions don't interfere with the automatic
        rotation system used by create_monthly_playlist.
